# Multi-Authentication (User, Seller, Admin) Starter Kit

This starter kit provides a foundation for building a secure and scalable multi-authentication backend API using Node.js, Express, and Passport. It supports authentication for users, sellers, and admins. Please note that this kit focuses on the backend, and no React frontend is included.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following environment variables set up:

- `MONGO_URL`: MongoDB connection URL for your database.
- `NODE_ENV`: Node.js environment (e.g., 'development', 'production', 'test').
- `PORT`: Port number on which the server will run.
- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication.

Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running, and update the `MONGO_URL` accordingly.

## Features

- User, Seller, and Admin authentication with Passport.js.
- JWT-based authentication for securing routes.
- NoSQL backend using MongoDB for data storage.
- API routes for user management, seller management, and admin functionality.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/your-repo/multi-auth-starter-kit.git
  ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
  cd node-express-multi-auth-starter-kit
  ```

4. Install dependencies:
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

5. Set up your environment variables in a .env file based on the required variables mentioned above.

6. Start the server:
  ```sh
  npm start
  ```

## Usage
- Access the API endpoints for user, seller, and admin functionality using your preferred API client (e.g., Postman).
- Utilize the multi-guard middleware to control access to specific routes based on user roles.

## Multi-Guard Middleware
- This starter kit includes a multi-guard middleware that allows you to apply fine-grained access control to your routes based on user roles (user, seller, admin).
  
## Contributing
- Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have improvements to suggest, please open an issue or create a pull request.

## Acknowledgments
- This project was built with inspiration from various open-source projects and contributors in the Node.js and Express community.

Note: This starter kit focuses solely on the backend. If you need a frontend React application to complement this backend, consider building a separate React frontend application that consumes this API.
